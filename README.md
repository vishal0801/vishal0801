## 🧾 Projects
Here are a few projects I have worked on recently:

1. **Dashboard**
  This project is a dynamic and responsive dashboard application built using React.js to provide real-time data visualization and monitoring. The dashboard fetches live data from a backend database via RESTful APIs, ensuring that users always have access to the most current information.
  
  ***Key Features***
  -Real-time Data Fetching: Utilizes asynchronous API calls to retrieve live data from the server, keeping the dashboard content continuously updated without manual refresh.

  -React.js Frontend: Built with React to create a modular, component-based UI that is both scalable and maintainable.

  -API Integration: Seamlessly connects with backend services through RESTful APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.

  -Responsive Design: Ensures usability across different devices and screen sizes for a consistent user experience.

  -State Management: Efficiently manages application state to reflect live data changes instantly.

  -User friendly Interface: Presents data in an organized and visually appealing manner, enabling quick insights and decision-making.
